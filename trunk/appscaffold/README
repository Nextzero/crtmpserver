Use the init script to create a basic application structure
This script will do the following for you:
1. Create a minimal application with necessary sources
2. Subscribe the newly created app to the cmake build system
3. Create a NetBeans project for it (only for MacOS X for now)
4. Create a win32 project for it (Not yet implemented....)


TO RUN IT YOU MUST BE IN THE appscaffold DIRECTORY!!!!!

Eg:

$ ./init MyBrandNewApp "The description of my new app"

After that, you can safely go to cmake build dir and start the build 
process

$ cd ../builders/cmake
$ sh cleanup.sh
$ cmake .
$ make

And finally run the server (stay in the cmake dir)

$ ./crtmpserver/crtmpserver ./crtmpserver/crtmpserver.lua

Notice that I've used CamelCase notation. You can use whatever
notation you want, but I suggest to use CamelCase because is
used all over the project

After executing the above init command, your app is created as follows:
(relative to your checkout dir)

1. The sources: sources/applications/<app_name>/[src|include]/[*.h|*.cpp]
2. The buildsystems:
	-- for cmake:	builders/cmake/applications/<app_name>/CMakeLists.txt
			altered the builders/cmake/applications/CMakeLists.txt 
			and added a new entry for the new app
	-- netbeans:	builders/netbeans/osx/<app_name> (Yeah, I know, I will
			do the other platforms as well...)
	-- VS2008:	NOT YET ADDED


Happy coding!
